            <p>The redrock desert and spires of scenic Monument Valley have been the setting for countless movies and advertisements. This is the land of the Navajo, where 
                scenery and Native American culture have created a perfect setting for photography. </p>

            <p>Stunning stone arches and rolling petrified dunes, backed by the often snow-capped peaks of the La Sal Mountains, make this one of the most scenic parks in Utah. 
                Arches National Park is home to more than 2,000 natural stone arches. The most famous of these, and the most photographed, is Delicate Arch, standing like a 
                horseshoe jutting out of the ground, framing the distant mountains. </p>

            <p>Like a scene from an old western film, red rock buttes rise up from the orange desert floor, and occasionally a horse and rider even wanders by. This is Monument 
                Valley Navajo Tribal Park, located on the Navajo Indian Reservation on the Utah-Arizona border.</p>

            <p>Goblin Valley includes an area where soft sandstone has eroded into interesting shapes, somewhat resembling goblins. In some spots the rock formations are close together 
                and produce a maze-like playground ideal for family explorations.</p>

            <p>The same forces of nature that shaped Bryce Canyon were at work in Cedar Breaks, creating a smaller but equally dynamic-looking amphitheater. Dominated by colorful hoodoos, 
                the amphitheater is more than 2,000 feet deep and three miles in diameter.</p>
